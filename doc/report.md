##Genetic Algorithm

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithm premised on the
evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetic. The basic concept of GAs is
designed to simulate processes in natural system necessary for evolution,
specifically those that follow the principles first laid down by Charles Darwin
of survival of the fittest.
